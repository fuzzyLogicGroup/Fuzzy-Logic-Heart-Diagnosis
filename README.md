# Fuzzy-Logic-Heart-Diagnosis
The number of people with heart disease is increasing every day. Like any other disease, early diagnosis in heart diseases is crucial for determining the risk, taking necessary precautions, or starting appropriate treatment as soon as possible. The continuous development of technology and the use of fuzzy logic systems in the field of health play a significant role in the early diagnosis of heart disease and ensuring accurate diagnosis. In this study, a fuzzy system is designed for determining the risk of heart disease. The system consists of 24 rules and has a MISO (Multi Input Single Output) system structure with 6 inputs and a single output. The input values are the person's age, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, LDL, and HDL levels. The output value is the "risk," which is composed of the Mamdani inference engine and a center of gravity defuzzifier. The risk of being a heart patient is calculated by applying the necessary processes to the information obtained from the user.# Fuzzy-Logic-Heart-Diagnosis
